########################################
Welcome to Workflow's documentation!
########################################

A Python toolkit for building interatomic potential creation and atomistic simulation workflows.

Documentation in progress! 

The main functions of Workflow is to efficiently parallelise operations over a set of atomic configurations. Given an operation that is defined to act a single configuration (e.g. evaluate energy of a structure with CASTEP ASE calculator), Workflow may apply the operation to multiple configurations in parallel.

The overall design of the workflow system (e.g. how configurations are handled, mechanism to parallelise operations) are covered in :ref:`Design overview <design_overview>`. Currently implemented self-contained per-configuration operations are sketched out in :ref:`Operations <operations>`. Descriptions of Workflows, built out of these modular operations are described in :ref:`Workflows <workflows>`. There are also descriptions :ref:`command line interface <command_line>`, :ref:`examples <examples>` of common tasks to get started with and a :ref:`Python API <api>`
